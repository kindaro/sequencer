* Write code.
* Write proofs.
* Write description.
* Package.

* Rewrite everything with `trySynchronous` instead of `catchSynchronous`.
* Write an equivalent of `redundant` with continuation transformer? Or decide it to be a separate

* Adjust type variables in the definition of `redundant`.
    -- to what? Did I do that?

* I should check things. Expecially this fancy new `cool` function.
